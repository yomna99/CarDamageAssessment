# Car Damage Detection and Segmentation Project

This project primarily focuses on detecting and segmenting damages in car images. It is divided into four distinct parts:

1. **Image Classification:**
   - Classifying images into those generated by AI and real images.
   - Models used: CNN and Inception.
   - Results: CNN yielded better results with a `val_accuracy` of 0.90625 compared to Inception (0.75000).

2. **Damage Degree Classification:**
   -classification into 3 classes: severe/moderate/minor damage 
   - Fine-tuning of ResNet50 and Xception models by freezing certain layers.
   - Results: Xception demonstrated better performance with a `val_accuracy` of 0.84375, surpassing ResNet50 (0.54902).

4. **Damage Detection and Segmentation:**
   - Utilizing MaskRCNN and YOLOv8 for segmentation and detection.
   - Database with 6 damage classes["lamp broken", "glass shatter","flat tire", "crack", "dent", "scratch"] 
   - Results: YOLOv8 outperformed MaskRCNN.
   
   -These are the results concerning maskRCNN model :

6. **Repair Cost Estimation:**
   - Based on the severity of the damage in the car.

7. **Streamlit Application:**
   - All steps summarized in a Streamlit application.
   - A demo video of the application is available.
